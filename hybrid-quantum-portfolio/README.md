# Hybrid AI & Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization

An end-to-end framework for portfolio construction combining
classical risk modeling, machine learning, and quantum-inspired
optimization techniques under realistic trading constraints.

## Project Overview

This project implements a full-stack portfolio optimization pipeline that
demonstrates how **hybrid AI and quantum-inspired optimization** can outperform
classical heuristics under realistic financial constraints.

The framework combines:

- Classical financial risk modeling
- Scenario-aware covariance estimation
- Unsupervised machine learning for market regime detection
- Constraint-aware optimization (cardinality, turnover, transaction costs)
- Quantum-inspired solvers formulated via QUBO

All methods are evaluated on the **same data, asset universe, and constraints**
to ensure a fair and rigorous comparison.
